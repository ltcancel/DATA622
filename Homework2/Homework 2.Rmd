Based on the latest topics presented, bring a dataset of your choice and create a Decision Tree where you can solve a classification or regression problem and predict the outcome of a particular feature or detail of the data used.
Switch variables to generate 2 decision trees and compare the results. Create a random forest for regression and analyze the results.

Based on real cases where desicion trees went wrong, and 'the bad & ugly' aspects of decision trees (https://decizone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-of-using-decision-trees), how can you change this perception when using the decision tree you created to solve a real problem?

Format: document with screen captures & analysis.
